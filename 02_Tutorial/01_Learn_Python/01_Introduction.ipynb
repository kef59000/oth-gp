    "Hello and welcome to your first programming class! Today, we're going to learn some very basic concepts about computers, programming, and the Python language. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Programming? (10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is like giving instructions to a computer. Imagine you're teaching a very literal-minded friend how to make a sandwich. You'd need to explain every single step in detail. That's what programming is like ‚Äì we write very specific instructions for computers to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers don't understand human languages like English or German. They operate using a binary system of 0s and 1s. Programming languages, like Python, act as a bridge between human language and machine language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the AI Chatbot?\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, it has gotten a whole lot easier to talk to Computers recently through the advent of so-called Large Language Models or, more generally, Generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are a Game-Changer for programmers and in this course, you will learn why this is the case and how to leverage its full potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the course, you will find banners such as this.\n",
    "Whenever you come across this banner, it means that you should interact with Jupyternaut, our very own AI Coding Assistant.\n",
    "Under the hood, Jupyternaut runs OpenAI's ChatGPT 4o-mini, one of the latest and most powerful Large Language Models.\n",
    "It is perfect for coding assistance. Let's try it out!\n",

    "Let's ask our AI assistant for more information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at the Jupyter AI chat window on the left side of your screen\n",
    "2. At the bottom, you'll see a place where you can type\n",
    "3. Click in that space\n",
    "4. Type this question exactly: **What are some real-world examples of computer programming?**\n",
    "5. Press the `Enter` key on your keyboard\n",
    "6. Wait for the AI to respond, then read its answer\n",

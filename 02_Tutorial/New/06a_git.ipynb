    "Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others. It lets you save versions of your work, go back to previous versions, and work with others on the same project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Repository (repo):** A folder tracked by Git.\n",
    "- **Commit:** A snapshot of your changes.\n",
    "- **Branch:** A parallel version of your project.\n",
    "- **Merge:** Combining changes from different branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:**\n",
    "1. In your own words, what is a Git repository?\n",
    "2. Why is version control important for programming projects?\n"

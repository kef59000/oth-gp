    "Congratulations! You've successfully improved the Pizza Paradise ordering system. Let's review what we've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functions help us organize code and reduce repetition, following the DRY principle.\n",
    "2. The KISS principle encourages us to keep our code simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "3. Scope determines where variables can be accessed. Use global variables judiciously.\n",
    "4. Testing helps us ensure our code works correctly.\n",
    "5. Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles and practices help us write better, more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional practice:\n",
    "1. Add a new feature to track the most popular pizza type, keeping the DRY and KISS principles in mind.\n",
    "2. Create a function to apply a percentage-based discount instead of a fixed amount.\n",
    "3. Write more test cases to ensure all parts of the system work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next session, we'll explore more complex data structures to store pizza menus, customer orders, and more!"
